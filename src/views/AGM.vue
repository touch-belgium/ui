               Every year in the first three months of the year Touch
               Belgium holds its Annual General Meeting. This is an
               opportunity for members to come along and find out more
               about the activities of Touch Belgium, and how the
               sport is being developed. The AGM is open to anyone who
               wishes to attend.
            </p>
