            <h2>What is Touch ?</h2>
            <p class="text-justify">
               Touch is a fast-paced, dynamic, minimal contact team
               sport. It focuses on speed, agility, communication and
               teamwork.
            </p>

            <p class="text-justify">
               It is a fitness-focused sport for both males and
               females, for all ages and abilities and is growing
               rapidly.

            <p class="text-justify lead font-italic">
               Why play touch ?
            </p>

            <ul>
               <li>
                  <strong>It is open to everyone</strong> - there is
                  no maximum age limit. It is family friendly, with
                  family members often playing in the same team. Touch
                  is played at all levels in Belgium, from beginners
                  to competitive level. Junior level competitive Touch
                  starts at U15, and continues up to Over 65s.
               </li>
               <li>
                  <strong>It is a safe sport</strong> - that is based
                  on minimal contact which greatly reduces the risk of
                  injury. Players are not allowed to tackle, and the ball
                  needs to be placed momentarily on the ground each time
                  the attacking player carrying the ball is touched by
                  the defence.
               </li>
               <li>
                  <strong>It is dynamic</strong> - each team has six
                  touches to try and score, so players are always looking
                  to create gaps to run through. As soon as the ball is
                  dropped, there is a change of possession. As a Touch
                  player, you learn to pass and catch to a high standard
                  very quickly!
               </li>
               <li>
                  <strong>It has an even gender split</strong> - with
                  almost as many women playing as men. In Belgium, there
                  are X number of female players and X number of male
                  players. There are opportunities to play competitively
                  as a mixed team, or as a men's or women's only team.
               </li>
            </ul>
